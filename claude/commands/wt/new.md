I need you to create a new git worktree using our organized project structure.

**Task:** Create a new worktree for: $ARGUMENTS

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt new $ARGUMENTS
```

After the worktree is created, switch to it and be ready to work on the task. The `git wt new` command will:
- Create the worktree in `.worktrees/` directory
- Set up the branch properly
- Create session tracking files
- Handle all the git worktree complexity

Once you're in the new worktree directory, let's start working on: $ARGUMENTS
