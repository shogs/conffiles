I need you to resume work in a specific git worktree with full context.

**Task:** Resume work in worktree: $ARGUMENTS

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt resume $ARGUMENTS
```

The `git wt resume` command will:
- Switch to the specified worktree
- Show previous session information
- Display current status and any changes
- Start a new shell in the worktree directory

After resuming, I'll help you continue with the previous task or start something new in this worktree context.
