I need you to help clean up completed git worktrees to keep the workspace organized.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt clean
```

The `git wt clean` command will:
- Show current worktrees
- Identify merged branches that can be safely removed
- Ask for confirmation before deleting anything
- Handle the git worktree removal process

I'll guide you through the cleanup process and ensure nothing important is deleted.
