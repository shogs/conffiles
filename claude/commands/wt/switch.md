I need you to switch to an existing git worktree.

**Task:** Switch to worktree: $ARGUMENTS

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt switch $ARGUMENTS
```

The `git wt switch` command will:
- Change to the correct worktree directory
- Show session information and current status
- Display any uncommitted changes
- Start a new shell in the worktree directory

After switching, let me know what you'd like to work on in this worktree.
