I need you to show me a comprehensive overview of my entire worktree development environment.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt status
```

The `git wt status` command will provide:
- Current location (main repo or which worktree)
- Overview of all active worktrees
- Summary statistics
- Status of each worktree (clean, has changes, etc.)

After showing the status, I'll provide recommendations on:
- Which worktree needs attention
- Suggested next actions
- Any cleanup opportunities
