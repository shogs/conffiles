I need you to switch to an existing git worktree with full shell isolation.

**Task:** Switch to worktree with shell: $ARGUMENTS

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt switch -s $ARGUMENTS
```

The `git wt switch -s` command will:
- Change to the correct worktree directory
- Show session information and current status
- Display any uncommitted changes
- Optionally copy node_modules from repository root (if available)
- Start a new worktree shell with environment tracking
- Set prompt indicator showing current worktree branch

The shell will have environment variables set for smart navigation:
- Use `git wt root` to exit the worktree shell and return to main repo
- Or type `exit` to return to previous location

**node_modules Copying:**
If node_modules exists in the repository root and doesn't exist in the worktree, you'll be prompted:
```
ðŸ“¦ node_modules found in repository root
Copy node_modules to worktree? [Y/n]:
```
This allows each worktree to have its own isolated dependencies without running `npm install`.

This provides full shell isolation for focused work sessions. The shell environment is tracked so you can easily return to where you started.

After switching, let me know what you'd like to work on in this worktree.
