I need you to show me all current git worktrees in our organized structure.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
git wt list
```

The `git wt list` command will show:
- All worktrees in `.worktrees/` directory
- Their current status and session information
- Any uncommitted changes
- Creation dates and task descriptions

After showing the list, help me decide what to work on next or suggest any cleanup that might be needed.
